# AVL Tree Visualizer

A modern desktop-based AVL Tree Visualization tool built using Java Swing.

This project demonstrates the implementation of a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (AVL Tree) along with a graphical interface to visualize insertions and automatic rotations.

---

##  Project Overview

An AVL Tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree where the height difference between left and right subtrees (balance factor) is at most 1 for every node.

This application allows users to:

- Enter multiple node values
- Automatically insert them into an AVL Tree
- Observe balancing through rotations
- Visualize the tree structure graphically

---

##  Features

- Interactive GUI
- Automatic AVL balancing
- LL, RR, LR, RL rotations
- Graphical tree rendering
- Reset functionality
- Modern gradient UI
- Executable JAR file included

---

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Java Swing (GUI)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data Structures (AVL Tree)

---

## How To Run

### Option 1: Run Executable JAR (Recommended)

Make sure Java is installed.

Run:
java -jar AVLTreeVisualizer.jar
